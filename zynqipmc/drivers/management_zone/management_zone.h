 * A single management zone controller driver for the ZYNQ-IPMC custom IP.

 * The IP is used to control power pins and allows to build a virtual power tree
 * in software which is then used to react to external faults.
 *
 * Faults are generally wired from the SensorProcessor IP to this IP and the firmware
 * keeps track of faults in real-time. If a fault is detected the firmware will take care
 * of turning the corresponding power tree branch and its children off.
 *
 * The subclass Zone is what discriminates several power zones or branches.
